Project: AI Finance/Budgeting Advice

This project reads an excel spreadsheet with data on spending habits + budgeting. It uses this to generate context and offer advice and/or changes that can possibly be made by the user. The program utilizes the pandas and streamlit library. The pandas library reads the spreadsheet and returns it as a dataframe. OpenAI is used to offer advice based on this financial data and a user-inputed question. The streamlit library is used to display the application that runs the program. 

This is a simple application that serves to give me practice on using the streamlit and pandas libraries, and allows me to incorporate OpenAI into my programs as well.
